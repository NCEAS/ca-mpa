# Decadal Review of California's Marine Protected Area (MPA) Network

This is the GitHub repository for an [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) Working Group leading the [Decadal Review of California's Marine Protected Area (MPA) Network](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/MPAs/Management/Decadal-Review). This work is funded by the OPC and CDFW.

## Repository structure

The GitHub repository contains all of the code associated with the project and the figures produced by this code. 

The data for the project are kept in a Google Drive folder outside the GitHub repository. Non-confidential data will be made available in a public data repository upon project completion.

The GitHub repository has the following structure

* **data:** This folder contains subfolders for each dataset used in the project. The subfolders contain scripts that clean and visualize the data. Figures for visualizing each dataset are contained within a *figures* folder inside each subfolder.
* **analyses:** This folder contains subfolders that contain the analyses conducted for each paper. Paper subteams may structure the contents of these subfolders in whatever manner is best for them.

## Repository best practices

We ask that contributors adhere to the following best practices when working in the repository:

1. Use lower case for all folders and file names
2. Use underscores for spaces (don't use hyphens or spaces)
