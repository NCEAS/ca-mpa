Effort away from MPAs
Working out edge cases where nearest MPA is not really the one where they are fishing

Sites on southeast end of Santa Cruz paired to offshore - which isn't lobster habitat

Jenn thinks bias in who reports lat/long and who doesn't

Account for de facto MPAs at San Clemente (Northwest corner)

Sea cucumbers have big MPA effect in monitoring data

About 2 year advance warning of where MPAs were going



Replacement seems okay to me?

David - suggests including landings/revenues, also suggests taking 2 counterfactuals
Support for idea about including MPAs with just a sliver of MPA coverage
Potentially decrease calipers for area or pick metric

Level of exposure - wave, wind, product?

Should we loosen area and scale to area after? Or should we tighten area. Basically, there are only a few small blocks




Jenn - Spillover paper (contrasting sea cucumber and dive fishery), plus kelp forest dive data

Rick - single species vs. all species 

Can species with no expectations for MPA benefits be used as counterfactuals?
