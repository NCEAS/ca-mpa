# Process CCFRP Data
# Cori Lopazanski
# October 2024

# About --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Goal: Separate processing code from biomass conversion code, and review all steps
# for errors and potential concerns that could propagate.

# Summary of key changes from original code:
# - Corrected NA values upon reading data (several just empty)
# - Keeping total_fishes_caught longer in the processing highlights that there
#   are a few values where there is length data but no species code listed - 
#   these were dropped or coded as NO_ORG drifts but there are actually fish
#   counted at higher levels

# Note potential concerns for next steps:
# - See above
# - The "total_caught_fishes" doesn't always add up (see end of script)
# - There is one Trip ID (SPR08291814 in 2018) that lists Grid Cell SP14 as 
#   both MPA and REF. The rest of the years, SP14 is only REF. Currrent approach 
#   corrects SP14 to REF.

# PI Recommend drop Trinidad (but likely better to do this later as there 
# may be other sites with no affiliated MPA; esp in other habitats) 

# CCFRP did their own length weight conversion which is included in ccfrp_effort
# that is already loaded. We are going to process their data and apply our own biomass
# conversion params to make sure the same params are applied for species shared 
# between habitats (kelp forest and deep reef). We can use the ccfrp_effort table
# to QAQC our processed data. cpue and no. caught fishes should match exactly. 
# bpue might be slightly different since we are using our own conversion params. 
# it would be worthwhile at some point to compare how well our estimates align with theirs. 
# -- We checked our effort calculations versus the effort table = those match (CL on 8 Sept 2023)
# -- Will perhaps still want to check the CPUE; see above comment about caught fishes
