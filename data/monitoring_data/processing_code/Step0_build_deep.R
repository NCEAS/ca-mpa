# Process Deep Reef Data

# About --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reading and processing steps adapted from Josh Smith, Step1_process_biomass.R

# Goal: Separate processing code from biomass conversion code, and review all steps
# for errors and potential concerns that could propagate. This script contains all major
# cleaning of the raw deep reef ROV data.

# Summary of key changes from original code:
# - Corrected treatment of NA values 
# - Several species still weren't matching with taxonomy table - fixed
# - Removed step that added duplicates for multiple affiliated MPAs (until can confirm - see below)
# - Updated target status for those that were not listed in original target status table
# - There are several combinations of group-site-designation that aren't in the main
#   deep reef site table - these have been discussed with the PI (RS) and confirmed 
#   treatment for each. Many of these cases are type == Reference and designation == Reference,
#   which we assume to be cases where a Reference site was sampled, and the type was incorrectly 
#   listed as "Reference" when it should have been either "SMR" or "SMCA." These were confirmed 
#   individually. 
#     * Farallon Island is associated with Southeast Farallon Island SMCA
#     * The mpa_name sometimes has multiple sites lislted; we do not use this and only
#       consider the MPA from the mpa_group column

# Build Data ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note: keeping this description for clarity but have confirmed will only use primary (Sept 2023)
# Names are not always consistently listed in order -- create primary, secondary, tertiary as follows:
# - When there is only one mpa_name given, it always matches the mpa_group + type listed 
# - If no mpa_name is given, the affiliated_mpa is the mpa_group + type listed with no secondary
# - When multiple mpa_names are given,
#      * If the first mpa_name listed matches the mpa_group + type listed, the affiliated_mpa
#         remains the mpa_group + type listed, and the second mpa_name becomes the secondary_mpa 
#      * If the first mpa_name listed does not match the mpa_group + type listed, 
#         the affiliated_mpa remains the mpa_group + type listed, and the first mpa_name 
#         becomes the secondary_mpa

#ensure that each MPA site has a single paired reference sites. 

#Steps:

#check structure
str(data)
str(duplicates)

#step 1: identify unique levels of 'type' for each mpa_group in the duplicates and
# drop the reference site for the SMCA if there is both an SMCA and SMR.
