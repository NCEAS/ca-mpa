# Process Deep Reef Data

# About --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reading and processing steps adapted from Josh Smith, Step1_process_biomass.R

# Goal: Separate processing code from biomass conversion code, and review all steps
# for errors and potential concerns that could propagate.

# Summary of key changes from original code:
# - Corrected treatment of NA values 
# - Several species still weren't matching with taxonomy table - fixed
# - Removed step that added duplicates for multiple affiliated MPAs (until can confirm - see below)
# - Removed conversion of Point Buchon SMR to Point Buchon SMCA (until can confirm w/ JS)
# - BIG NOTE: Removed changes to target status for now (until confirm best place to make those adjustments)

# Note potential concerns for next steps:
# - There are several combinations of group-site-designation that aren't in the main
#   deep reef site table
# - How to treat "Farallon Island" site (for which MPA?)
# - Site-related concerns: mpa_name sometimes has multiple sites listed; this is almost
#   always when a reference site is affiliated with MPAs, but there are two combinations where
#   MPA sites are associated with multiple references. There also does not seem to be a consistent
#   order of how these multiple names are listed (e.g. South Point and Gull Island) which makes
#   it difficult to determine which could be the "primary" vs "secondary" affiliated MPA
# - There is a combination where type == Reference and designation == Reference. For now we
#   treat these as reference sites.
# - Want to make sure we are consistent to how we assign the affiliated MPA when the transect
#   is near a cluster ... e.g. Asilomar and Pacific Grove are listed together, but why not also
#   Lovers Point and Julia Platt? Another concern: how would sites near San Miguel be appropriate
#   references for Santa Cruz Island?

# Build Data ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Secondary/Tertiary Naming Correction:
# Names are not always consistently listed in order -- create primary, secondary, tertiary as follows:
# - When there is only one mpa_name given, it always matches the mpa_group + type listed 
# - If no mpa_name is given, the affiliated_mpa is the mpa_group + type listed with no secondary
# - When multiple mpa_names are given,
#      * If the first mpa_name listed matches the mpa_group + type listed, the affiliated_mpa
#         remains the mpa_group + type listed, and the second mpa_name becomes the secondary_mpa 
#      * If the first mpa_name listed does not match the mpa_group + type listed, 
#         the affiliated_mpa remains the mpa_group + type listed, and the first mpa_name 
#         becomes the secondary_mpa
