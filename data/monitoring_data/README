This file provides meta data and descriptions of the data processing files.


**Biomass_raw_processing.R**
This file contains script used to aggregate raw biomass data from each 
monitoring group into a single exportable .csv file. The output of this script
contains bioamss data aggregated at the MPA-year level for each monitoring 
group and for targeted v. nontageted fish species. 

year = survey year
group = monitoring group
region3 = CDFW-designated monitoring regions
region4 = north, central, south, north channel islands
affiliated_mpa = mpa name
mpa_class = denotes whether mpa is SMR or SMCA
mpa_designation = denotes whether survey is SMR, SMCA, or Reference
target_status = denotes aggregate level of targeted or nontargeted species
sum_biomass = sum of the mean biomass for each targeted or nontargeted species


**Biomass_RR_processing.R**
This file calculates reponse ratios and other summary statistics at the 
MPA-year level for each monitoring group. NOTE: This script requires export data
from Biomass_raw_processing.R
